                                  The Property Fund is a revolutionary investment fund designed to provide investors with diversified
                                  opportunities within the Kenyan real estate market. Managed by ADAM Capital, the fund offers three
                                  distinct investment channels: Shamba Digital, Nyumba Digital, and ADAM Off-Takers.
                                  Interestingly, data analytics by realtors prove that over 80% of people buying
                                  land and houses in Kenya are average income-earners holding the bottom of the economic pyramid.
                                  Unsurprisingly up to 50% to 70% of these buyers end up defaulting repayments,
                                  faltering the success cycle of the real estate industry. The ADAM Property Fund comes as a resolute
                                  joinder of this by supplying realtors with a financing resource and creating an environment of
                                  ease of purchase for the buyers.
                                  To enhance the efficiency, ADAM integrates with an e-Jenga system, a construction
                                  tracking software designed to monitor the entire lifecycle of the construction process, from resource
                                  acquisition to completion and project signoff.
